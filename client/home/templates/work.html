  	<p (click) = "chode()">{{message}} I am currently the <span>LEAD FRONT-END DEVELOPER</span> at <span>STANZA</span>. I have desinged a scalable front-end architecture using <span>Angular 1.x</span>, which is comprised of modular custom directives that are shared across multiple angular apps. As a developer I am interested/investing time towards all new client side frameworks, such as <span>Angular 2.0</span> (this site is built using 2.0), <span>React with Flux</span>, <span>View</span>, <span>Ember</span> etc... I have also been working with <span>TypeScript</span> (Angular 2.0) and <span>Swift 2.0</span> to build ios apps. I am very comfortable with <span>CSS/SCSS/Stylus/Less</span>. I build my pages <span>mobile first</span> I do not require any bootstrapped templates. I have also written a descent amount of server side code for Stanza and for my personal projects. I have used <span>MongoDB</span>, <span>FIREBASE</span>, <span>MySql</span> and <span>Postgres</span>. I have set up webapps using <span>Express</span> as well as <span>Django</span> (a while ago). Over the last few months, I have been dedicating time towards becoming a better designer, by taking online courses and having one on ones with our talented designer at Stanza. I have taken courses for <span>C</span> and <span>Java</span> as well.</p>
