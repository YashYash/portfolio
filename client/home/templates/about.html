			<p>My name is <span>Yash Saxena</span>. I am a full stack web-developer with a passion for <span>Front-end development</span>. I have been the <span>Lead Front-end Engineer</span> at <span>Stanza</span> for 2 years now. At Stanza I was the first front-end developer, therefore I was in charge of making all the initial architectural decisions for our future client side app. I ended up choosing Angular 1.x due to it's stability at the time, as well as my prior expeirience with the framework and it was easier to hire an Angular developer, over an Ember or React one 2 years ago. Currently at Stanza we have 6 large Angular Apps in production, 5 of which were built by me. Outside of work, I spend time keeping up to date with new frameworks like Redux, Angular 2.0, React-native, Polymer etc... I love designing UI/UX as well as working with animations. Over the past few years, I have learned how to improve SEO, understand ways to optimize the fps ,to get smooth animations and dom rendering, create an efficient development environment and staying up to date with ECMA script releases.</p>
